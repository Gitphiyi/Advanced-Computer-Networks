## What is TLS/SSL?
TLS and SSL are essentially the same protocol except SSL is an older version of TLS. SSL was initially created in 1995 with SSL 2.0 and after SSL 3.0 it was replaced by the new TLS 1.0 in 1999. They both serve the same purpose of creating a secure connection between 2 endpoints, and for the purpose of simplicity, only the TLS protocol will be discussed further as SSL is entirely deprecated.

TLS is a secure communication protocol that enables encryption and authentication using digital certificates and a 4-way handshake
