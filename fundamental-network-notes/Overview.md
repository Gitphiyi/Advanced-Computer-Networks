# Network Notes
These notes come from my Duke CS 356 (Computer Networks) course in Spring 2025. They are meant as a review resource rather than a beginner’s guide. I’ve distilled and summarized the concepts I found most important, along with a roadmap for how to approach them. The goal is not to explain computer networks from the ground up, but to capture the key theory needed to dive deeper into the subject.
