# Cryptography
Cryptography is essential in computer networks because packets often pass through many different users and devices along the way. When confidential information is transmitted, it must remain secure even if third parties intercept the packet. Cryptographic techniques ensure that only the intended sender and receiver can understand the contents, preventing unauthorized access or tampering.

## Goal of Cryptography 

## Important Topics
- Primitives
- Symmetric vs Asymmetric Protocols

## Primitives
There are 4 different cryptographic primitives or the low-level algorithms that serve as building blocks for higher level cryptographic protocols. These primitives are built to be reliable and 
- Secure Hashing
- Encryption/Decryption
- Signing/Authenticating
- Key Exchange
