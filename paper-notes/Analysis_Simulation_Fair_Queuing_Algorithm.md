# Analysis and Simulation of a Fair Queuing Algoirthm
What is your take-away message from this paper?
- Because the algorithm people choose to queue packets is determined by the user, FCFS is not an adequately fair queuing strategy. Instead, there needs to exist a different queuing algorithm that fairly allocates the network to different sources. This paper aims to prove that the new algorithm is fair under varying circumstances. What I took away from this paper is that algorithms shouldn't be designed in a manner where people are expected a certain behavior. Algorithms need to account for the worst action a user can do, and still achieve the goal that it is meant to achieve.
